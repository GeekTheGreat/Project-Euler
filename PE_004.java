/*
 * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
 * The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 * Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 *
 * SOLUTION
 * We will test products of 2 two-digit numbers for palindromes. We will count them downwards because
 * there is higher probability that program will find large palindrom and we can stop checking  
 * numbers when their product is starting to be too small.
 *
 * RESULT: 906609
